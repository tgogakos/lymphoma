#Notes on Redy...Dave (Cell 2017)
- The sample size of 400 tumor-normal pairs provided nearly 100% power for
the discovery of genes mutated in 10% of patients and over 90% power to 
detect genes mutated in 5% of DLBCL patients. 

-The distribution of somatic alterations in tumor-normal pairs was used to 
identify 150 putative driver genes that were recurrently mutated in DLBCL.
