#Notes on Redy...Dave (Cell 2017)
- The sample size of 400 tumor-normal pairs provided nearly 100% power for
the discovery of genes mutated in 10% of patients and over 90% power to 
detect genes mutated in 5% of DLBCL patients. 

-The distribution of somatic alterations in tumor-normal pairs was used to 
identify 150 putative driver genes that were recurrently mutated in DLBCL. 

-We then defined genetic alterations for all 1,001 DLBCLs corresponding to 
these 150 genes, identifying variants that meet the criteria for driver mutations.

-We found that these two [ABC and GCB] subgroups shared the vast majority of driver 
genes at statistically indistinguishable frequencies. 

-The MuTect somatic mutations were used as a hig-quality discovery dataset for
identifying mutated genes, 
- Variant filtering criteria:
  - exonic
  - not synonymous
  - somatic
  - rare and damaging
  - excluding duplicate frameshifts in multiple samples
  - not in repetitive regions
  - not with poor coverage (?)
  - genotype quality > 30
  - read depth > 5
- Driver analysis:
  i) MutsigCV (driver mutations above background mutation rate)
  ii) Hotnet2 (subnetworks of genes based on protein interactions

  #Notes on Chapuy...Shipp (Nature Medicine 2018)
  - 304 newly diagnosed DLBCLs
  
  - We detected muations usign WES from 304 (55% lacked patient-matched normal samples)
  
  - filtered germline variants and artifacts from tumor-only samples 
  
  - applied MutSig2CV and detected 98 CCGs (q value <0.1)
  
  - assessed recurrent SVs using a previously targeted sequencing approach and 
  a pipeline that included four different algorithms
